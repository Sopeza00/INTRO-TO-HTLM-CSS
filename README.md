htlm consist of 3 web languages which are javascript,css and also htlm
in java scrript you learn that its a very delicate language it can giveup when the code its running is not correct but when it comes to htlm it does not care whether the code is correct or has errors nit will help you find the error the fix it for you. css helps weith styling the web pAGES YOU WANT to CREATE.

when debugging and troubleshoting is basicslly about find an error in the code you working on or the one you are given also you shold check on the requirements needed on the code you working on
we use attributes to make changes to any htlm tangs. the attribute is always followed by the value of the thing you want to to make changes on
ARIA ROLE THESE ARE THE EXTRA ATTRIBUTES THAT YOU CAN ADD ON YOU ELEMENTs to make them more meaningful and understatable to other browsers when presenting. when you want to provide essensial information to assesive te chnologies such as sceen readers and mignifiers to ensure that the website you created is easly accessable. all this aria role started when web started replacing native applications to ensure a full use of the application.
htlm navigation and links
htlm links to create them are usuaLLY EASY NIN TERMS OF CODE. it also has an impact on information sharing, computing and our morden world as a whole is truly profound, we encount link everywhere we go, navigations bars packs with information
when creating a link we use the lement "a" which is an enchor. this element is inline so it can be placed within a paragraphy.
the difference between HTTP and HTTPS is that the "s" in HTTPSstands for secure which means these days you can never login your personal details and everyone can be able to access them withut your permission since it is highly protected while in HTTP your details were at risk of being used by anyone since there was no high security back in the days. when creating a link as a content creator you have to incude yourself

IMAGES
images are what make a cover page or an home page for your website more attractive.
it has FOUR ATTRIBUTES namely:-
source attribute (SRC) this one tells us which image is good to upload
alt attribute (ALT) this one shows the description of an image
width and leghth attribute thois tells us the size of the image
It does not matter whether the height or the width is specified first. In HTML, the order of attributes within an element can be whatever you prefer.

IMAGE FORMAT
There are FOUR types of how images are formatted and they namely as follows:-
GIF- these are the compressing illustraions of large areas
SVG- these are perfect for webpages where you will be able to create logos and icons infact it can be use for any type of illustraion. you can scale it to any size tyou want without it losing its quality, it is also a programming language for graphics.
JPG- digital camras use this kind of format on the images, it is mostly used to compress photographs. this format can find balance on size and quality when it is used to compress an image.
PNG- this one is used when you want transperancy on the photographs. you can also use it to combine GIF&SVG images.

RESPONSIVE IMAGES
The css provides a solutin for displaying images on large or small screens wheather in different sizes and quality
It is important to note that in a typical web browsing scenario, where users view a web page on a single screen with a fixed viewport size, only the appropriate image file is downloaded, saving on unnecessary downloads.

WORKING wITH MEDIA
WORKING WITH AUDIO
Audio is the same as images it has diffent kind of formarts but it has openind and closing taps with makes it modern and flexing and mor powerful.
when adding the Ã§ontrol' attribute it give you more power to be able to create your own thing without starting from strach.
There are other attributes that can be used with the audio element too. For example, "loop" will make the file repeat from the beginning once it reaches the end. "Autoplay" can automatically play the audio as soon as the page loads, but be cautious with this one as most people dislike it when audio starts playing on a webpage without their consent. 
WORKING WITH VIDEOS
we use te element <video> to fix videos on to web pages. the video element also have close and open tags 
there are two types of video formats we are familiar with which are:-
standard quality trhis one caters for videos with low resolutions and less data it is also known as MP4
high difinition(HD) this one has good quality wich caters for the videos with high resolution and has large data and high pixels
Due to the intricacies involved, it is common for websites to utilize embed codes from video hosting services rather than directly employing the video element. This choice is often made to simplify the process and leverage the capabilities provided by such services.

CAPTION AND SUBTITLES
CAPTION
this one is a texual representation of the audio in a video, it helps those who can not understand the content on the video
SUBTITLE
this one allows a user to be able to change language on the video to the language they will be able to understand.

EMBENDDING MEDIA VIA IFRAME
Embedding refers to taking content from one site and placing it within the middle of another site's page. 
iframe is ude to display a webpage or document within a webpage.

HTML Content Identification
HTML Language Support 
 In HTML, there are tools to indicate the language of your content.
 It is important for computers to know the language of the content it is processing. If the whole page is in one language, it is quite simple
