IMAGES
images are what make a cover page or an home page for your website more attractive.
it has FOUR ATTRIBUTES namely:-
source attribute (SRC) this one tells us which image is good to upload
alt attribute (ALT) this one shows the description of an image
width and leghth attribute thois tells us the size of the image
It does not matter whether the height or the width is specified first. In HTML, the order of attributes within an element can be whatever you prefer.

IMAGE FORMAT
There are FOUR types of how images are formatted and they namely as follows:-
GIF- these are the compressing illustraions of large areas
SVG- these are perfect for webpages where you will be able to create logos and icons infact it can be use for any type of illustraion. you can scale it to any size tyou want without it losing its quality, it is also a programming language for graphics.
JPG- digital camras use this kind of format on the images, it is mostly used to compress photographs. this format can find balance on size and quality when it is used to compress an image.
PNG- this one is used when you want transperancy on the photographs. you can also use it to combine GIF&SVG images.

RESPONSIVE IMAGES
The css provides a solutin for displaying images on large or small screens wheather in different sizes and quality
It is important to note that in a typical web browsing scenario, where users view a web page on a single screen with a fixed viewport size, only the appropriate image file is downloaded, saving on unnecessary downloads. 

UNIT 6

WORKING wITH MEDIA
WORKING WITH AUDIO
Audio is the same as images it has diffent kind of formarts but it has openind and closing taps with makes it modern and flexing and mor powerful.
when adding the Ã§ontrol' attribute it give you more power to be able to create your own thing without starting from strach.
There are other attributes that can be used with the audio element too. For example, "loop" will make the file repeat from the beginning once it reaches the end. "Autoplay" can automatically play the audio as soon as the page loads, but be cautious with this one as most people dislike it when audio starts playing on a webpage without their consent. 
WORKING WITH VIDEOS
we use te element <video> to fix videos on to web pages. the video element also have close and open tags 
there are two types of video formats we are familiar with which are:-
standard quality trhis one caters for videos with low resolutions and less data it is also known as MP4
high difinition(HD) this one has good quality wich caters for the videos with high resolution and has large data and high pixels
Due to the intricacies involved, it is common for websites to utilize embed codes from video hosting services rather than directly employing the video element. This choice is often made to simplify the process and leverage the capabilities provided by such services.

CAPTION AND SUBTITLES
CAPTION
this one is a texual representation of the audio in a video, it helps those who can not understand the content on the video
SUBTITLE
this one allows a user to be able to change language on the video to the language they will be able to understand.

EMBENDDING MEDIA VIA IFRAME
Embedding refers to taking content from one site and placing it within the middle of another site's page. 
iframe is ude to display a webpage or document within a webpage.

HTML Content Identification
HTML Language Support 
 In HTML, there are tools to indicate the language of your content.
 It is important for computers to know the language of the content it is processing. If the whole page is in one language, it is quite simple 

 The lang attribute
 The lang attribute is used to specify the language of a webpage. Set the language on the main element that wraps everything else, which is usually the HTML element. 
 The lang attribute has many options, not only to indicate language or regional versions of a language, but also other qualities like the writing system used. If your webpage has multiple languages, specify the language for each part of the content. Use the lang attribute on any element.

  Working with the lang and charset attributes
  ![image](https://github.com/Sopeza00/INTRO-TO-HTLM-CSS/assets/158051431/47a36055-fa23-4ea3-bc54-25f9f3198053)
  According to the examples, one of them is indicated that the content will be in British English and it goes left to right. The other example shows that this page is in Arabic and the content flows from right to left. When there is a mix of content, ensure to indicate the change in direction for each phrase is set.

The Meta Attribute
<meta> tags always go inside the <head> element, and are typically used to specify character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings.
Metadata will not be displayed on the page, but is machine parsable.

FORMS
<!Doctype HTML>
<html>
<body>

 <h3>SELF-SERVICE FORM</h3>
<form action="/action_page.php">
    <label for="fname">First name:</label><br>
    <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname" value="Sisipho"><br>
    <label for="lname">Last Name:</label><br>
    <input type="text" id="lname" name="lname" value="Sopeza"><br>
    <label for="email">Email Address:</label><br>
    <input type="text" id="email" name="email"value="sisiphotsipopo18@gmail.com"><br><br>
    <input type="submit" value="Submit">
    </form>
    
    <p>If you click the "Submit"button, the form-data will be sent to a page called "/action_page.php".</p>
    
    </body>
</html>


HTML Generic Elements, Div and Span
the element <div> is used for blocks and the element <span> is used to part lines
divs are used to create sections,sidebars and everything in between. before 2010 people using html used to rely more on div element  for all sorts of purposes.
technically you can get away with everything if you are using div and span elements

HTML Integration
HTML Page
HTML and all the elements, attributes, roles, and tools used to mark up content on websites or web apps have been covered. 
HTML files are a vital part of the web. HTML plays a major role in explaining what these things are, but it is not just limited to that.
The web server responds by sending back the specific HTML file located at that address. 

Once the HTML file is built, there are a few crucial parts that every web page needs. 

Firstly, the file should begin with a doctype statement, which indicates the era of this HTML file. In the past, there were different doctype declarations for older HTML versions. By including this one, we are saying, "Hey, this is a modern web page, so follow modern best practices and treat it accordingly." 
Next, we enclose everything else on the page within an HTML element, which means an element named HTML. It tells us that all the content within it is HTML. Place the opening HTML tag at the top and the closing HTML tag at the bottom. 
in HTML elements there are two main part where everything goes body and head. The head contains all the metadata that the browser needs to know but will not display on the page. The body, on the other hand, is for all the content and is composed of various elements already discussed in this course. The body is where most of the action happens. The doctype declaration, HTML head, and body elements are the essential building blocks of every web page.

UTF-8 it is the stardand format for unicode used to electronically commuticate.

Document Head
The HTML head serves as a central hub for connecting and setting up various components, ensuring that all assets are loaded and sharing page information with other sites and platforms. In a way, it is like the headquarters for getting the page off to a good start. Inside the head of a webpage, you put important information that the browser needs to know about the website. 

Content Structuring 
HTML has about 6 elements used to structure the body. 
in one of the elements used in the body of HTML  the main element is used once per page to wrap the main content, while the header, footer, article, section, and aside elements are the five sectioning elements in HTML. They are combined and nested to structure the content of a webpage.
1. main-The main element is used once per webpage and tells the browser where the main content is located.
2. header-The header and footer elements mark the header and footer areas on the page. Do not confuse header with head though. Head is where the file's metadata lives and is not displayed to users. Header is used for site headers, article headers, and headers within the content. A header is usually found at the top of most web pages and may include a logo, site name, and navigation.
3. footer-The footer signifies that there are extra things to convey, regardless of its position on the page.
4. article-An article often starts with a title, subtitle, author's name, and publication date, which can also be considered a header. Many web pages end with a footer at the bottom, containing links, copyright information, and additional details about the company. However, footers can also appear elsewhere. Some articles begin with metadata like hashtags or share buttons, which are suitable for a footer element. The article element wraps around any type of content unit, whether it is a long written article, a short snippet, a teaser card, a tweet, or even an app element. It represents a standalone unit of content.
5. section-The section element is used to mark sections of content. For example, in a long essay with subheadings, each segment can be wrapped in a section element. It is also useful for dividing different topic zones on a website. Each section typically starts with its own headline.
6. aside-Lastly, the aside element is for content that is off to the side, like sidebar information or additional details that accompany an article but are not part of its main flow. Advertisements can also be marked as an aside. Although the position on the page does not matter, the semantic meaning of these elements is crucial. The visual layout often conveys meaning, and these HTML elements help transfer that meaning from the design to the content.
